# HotDIR
Colorized directory listing for Windows CMD (or similar) - Originally by Tony Overfield and Robert Woeger

I've intentionally wrote this thing as one long routine because it is a clone of one of the most important utilities, to me, from the 80's and I wanted to try and capture that essence within the source itself.  So the are no user-defined functions, nor regular expressions because those things didn't exist to me back then.
